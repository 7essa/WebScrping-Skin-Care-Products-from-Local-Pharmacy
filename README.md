## About 
### The project
- This project was one of the required projects in Data Science Immersive Course provided by [General Assembly](https://www.linkedin.com/company/general-assembly-middle-east/).
- The aim of this project is to use the API and webscraping skills to create a dataset revolving around a topic, problem, clean it, properly document it, and submit it to the     Kaggle dataset repository.
     - Requirements
          - Gather and prepare your data using API or webscraping. A ready-made dataset is NOT allowed.
          - Make your data accessible and readable by using common open file formats like CSV.
          - Take the time to describe your dataset thoroughly.
          - Pick a clear, open license ensuring your dataset is reusable.
          - Publish a kernel on your dataset to help others learn how they can work with the data. The kernel should show features of the dataset with a plot or two to showcase               some variables in the dataset. Also raise potentially interesting questions that could be answered using this dataset.
           - Put your data collection and cleaning scripts in a repo.
