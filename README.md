-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Description

We have been using various datasets in the course that are either model/toy datasets or collected in conditions fairly remote to local relevance. With the newfound API and webscraping skills that you learned, this project challenges you to create a dataset revolving around a topic, problem, or theme of your choice, clean it, properly document it, and submit it to the Kaggle dataset repository. Curating and sharing a dataset is an integral part of your skills and practice as a data scientist that should not be overlooked!

For project 3, your goal is three-fold:

1. Define a domain, issue, and problem that you are interested in (preferably with local/regional relevance).
2. Collect, clean, and submit the data the Kaggle datasets repository under the course's organization.
3. Submit the data collection and a starter kernel in public associated to the published dataset.
